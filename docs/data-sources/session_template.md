- `immutable_session_storage` (Boolean) Prevent players from modifying the session storage.
- `inactive_timeout` (Number) Timeout value when inactive players will be removed from the session, based on disconnection event from the lobby.

`FRIENDS_OF_LEADER`: Only friends of the leader of the session can join, either via the session browser or via matchmaking.
`FRIENDS_OF_FRIENDS`: Only friends of friends of the leader of the session can join, either via the session browser or via matchmaking.

`INVITE_ONLY`: Only players who have received an invitation to join the session through either matchmaking, a player in the session requesting to add another player, or a join code that is automatically generated for the session, can join.
`CLOSED`: Players cannot initiate joining a session. They can still be purposefully added as part of matchmaking, or by the game client that requested the creation of the session.
